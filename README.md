# Codegarden 23 pre party beer pullrequest
This year [Damiaan](https://twitter.com/dampeebe) and [Sven](https://twitter.com/migaroez) are driving to Denmark for Codegarden instead of flying like usual. That means they have some space to contribute to the traditional [drinks pull request](https://umbraco.com/blog/codegarden-pre-party-and-drinks-pull-request/). So we thought it would be a good idea to let the community decide what drinks to bring along.

### Contribute
If you want to contribute some cans/bottles to the drinks pull request yourself but don't want to pay more money in postage than the drinks themselves, or you just don't have the space in your luggage to bring it, hit us up on twitter and we will do our best to help you out.

### Request
If you want us to bring a certain belgian beer you have been wanting to try, now is the time to make your dreams come true. Make a PR adding a line (or more) to the list below and we will try our best to please as many people as possible. Please, only make a PR if you are planning to attend the preparty.
If a certain beer is already in the list, feel free to just add your name behind the line.
